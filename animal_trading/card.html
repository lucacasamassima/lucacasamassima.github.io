            <p>The Dalmatian is a dog noted for its unique black or liver spotted coat</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Scientific Name:</b> Canis lupus familiaris</li>
                <li><b>Average Height:</b> 43-46cm</li>
                <li><b>Average Weight:</b> 22-29kg</li>
                <li><b>Average Lifespan:</b> 10-14 years</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The origins of the Dalmatian are still largely unknown, with its beginning buried so deep in the past that it is still debatable as to where the breed originated. In the late 18th century, there was a type of white spotted dog known as the
                Talbot Hound and these dogs were used to accompany horse-drawn carriages and guard the passengers and the cargo. In 1791, Thomas Bewick named this type of dog as the Dalmatian.</p>
