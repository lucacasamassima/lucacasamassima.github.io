# Feed Reader Project for Udacity Front End Nanodegree

# Project Overview

This project is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. Using the Jasmine libraries you could test that everything in your code goes well.


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


## How it work:

You can edit the code of "app.js" file (./js/app.js) and verify that something goes wrong at the buttom of the page. Using the expectations written inside the "feedreader.js" file (./jasmine/spec/feedreader.js), you can test various features of the page.

NOTE: The Jasmine version used in this project is the 2.2.

# How to use:

* Open "index.html" in your browser to see tests' results
* If you want to add new tests, you must modify the file "feedreader.js" (./jasmine/spec/feedreader.js")
* Enjoy the work;
