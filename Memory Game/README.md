### Instructions:

The game board consists of sixteen cards shuffled in a grid. The deck is made of the eight pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side.

The game is started when the player flips two cards.

On each turn:

The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.

The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.

If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.

If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state.

The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched, time is over or user loose all lives.
